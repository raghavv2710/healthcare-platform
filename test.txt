ðŸ§  Why This Happens?
When a patient logs out, Firebase signs them out asynchronously.

âœ… But their token in browser memory is still technically available for a very short split second.

âœ… So when you press "Back" button after logout, the browser loads the previous page (patient-dashboard.html) from cache.

âœ… The Firebase onAuthStateChanged takes 100-300ms to detect "Oh wait! user = null!"
=> during this tiny time, the patient dashboard renders for just a flash.
=> then redirects back to patient-login.html.

âœ… Then when you press back again, it shows landing/home page.
